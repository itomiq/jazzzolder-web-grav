"Erik was my teacher at a summer school for jazz in 2011, I was in his combo together 
with Casper Van De Velde where we learned to play music together. We never stopped playing since". 

Pianist Hendrik Lasure en saxofonist Erik Bogaerts leerden elkaar kennen op een jazz stage van Jeugd & Muziek in 
2010. Na deze ontmoeting bleven ze samenspelen en vormden de groep TaCaLaN (met Louis Frères, Casper Van De Velde, 
Egor Dubay) Hiermee wonnen ze de Belfius Classics Award voor Jazz in 2013. Sindsdien komen beide heren met regelmaat 
samen om in duo hun composities uit te werken of om standards in te studeren. In 2015 besloten ze om dit spelplezier 
te delen met een publiek door concerten te spelen en een eerste album op te nemen. 

Hendrik Lasure was born in Bruges in 1997. Best known for his duo project SCHNTZL, with Casper Van De Velde, he is currently 
in the jazz masters program at the KCB. 

At the age of three, he insisted on going to music school, there seemed to be no other option. The violin was his first love, 
but every night, when that duty had been fulfilled, he lost himself on the piano. In 2008 he attended the jazz workshop at the 
Knokke-Heist Music Academy open day, and a jazz addiction resulted from this. Werner Meert became his piano teacher and Janos 
Bruneel and Lander Vandenoordtgaate led his combos. Hendrik has participated in various summer jazz courses (i.a. Jeugd & Muziek 
Antwerp, Dworp, Dissipated orchestra course in The Nederlands) since 2009. His teachers were, to name a few, Erik Bogaerts, 
Steven Cassiers and Stef Minnebo. In June 2011, he received a scholarship from De Marnixring de Blinckaert. He participated in 
as many courses and masterclasses as possible (i.a. with Nathalie Loriers, Frank Vaganée, Kris Defoort, Christian Mendoza, ) and 
he was a recognised guest performer in De Werfs jam program in Bruges. Hendrik graduated from his bachelors degree at the KCB in 
2015 with the greatest distinction. 

Hendrik made his debut as a solo pianist at the Gaume jazz festival, in August 2012. With his quintet TACALAN, with TRIOPATED and 
as a solo pianist, he won a first prize at the Belfius Classics competition in 2013. In 2014, he appeared on Francesca Palamidessis 
album Other Words I Am Three, released on Ragtime Productions. 

Since 2014 Hendrik has played with SCHNTZL, his duo project with drummer Casper Van De Velde. In 2015 they won the STORM! contest, and 
two prizes at the Tremplin Jazz Concours dAvignon. In 2016 they will be releasing their debut album on De Werf label, and touring with 
the Jazzlab series. other notable projects include a duo with Erik Bogaerts. Having played together for the last three years, they have 
recorded a duo album, to be released in 2016.
