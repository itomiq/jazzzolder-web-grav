Since June 2004 Frederik has been mainly working with his own band. 
The Frederik Leroux Quartet tries to diversify the approach to each 
tune as much as possible and tries not to rely on standardized structures 
and forms too much. Besides improvisation, composition plays a crucial role 
in the concept of the band.
