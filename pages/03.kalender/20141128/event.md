Morgan Freeman
===============

*"A collective of composers and improvisers. Accepting and living in the moment to create new musical 
situations. Unpredictable, energetic, molding tradition and innovation."*

Morgan Freeman was born in summer of 2013 when a turn of events brought the 4 musicians together to play 
a six week long tour through Netherlands, Germany and Lithuania. Morgan Freeman's highly-eclectic repertoire 
consists of compositions of all band members, creating an original group sound where folk, punk-rock, 
contemporary classical and avant-garde meld with modern jazz. They continuously seek to cross genre-boundaries 
and challenge conventional norms. 

Morgan Freeman has performed in various venues in Europe including Cafe Alto 
and Bimhuis in Amsterdam, the Frankfurt Jazzkeller, BIX Jazzclub Stuttgart, B-Flat in Berlin, Trakai Fanfare Week, 
Artistai and Soulbox in Vilnius, Rysiu Kiemelis in Kaunas, and many more.
