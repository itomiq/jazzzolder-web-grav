As Guests has been since its founding in 1997 essentially a collaboration project 
between vibraphonist Miro Herak and pianist Michal Vanoucek. As the name suggests 
many different musicians have participated with them under this name. 
Lately the group has included Belgian bassist Janos Bruneel and Portuguese drummer Joao Lobo as regular members. 

After almost a year of the group playing together in this format, As Guests won in 2004 
the "Pim Jacobs Muziek Prijs" and "Dutch Jazz Competition" hosted annually by the North Sea Jazz Festival.
