#### 5 jaar jazzzolder.

Jonge afgestudeerde muzikanten van verschilende conservatoria. 

De muziek die ze spelen is geïnspireerd door de blue note jaren 60-70. 

Standards spelen ze niet echt, wel stukken die allemaal grooven of gewoon lekker swingen. 

Het is de bedoeling bij het de publiek de mondhoeken tot achter de oren te trekken.
