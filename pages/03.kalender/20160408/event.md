Gitarist Albert Vila is afkomstig uit Barcelona en heeft na zijn studies in Amsterdam en New York een origineel 
repertoire opgebouwd van eigen muziek. Hij brengt deze muziek samen met een ritmesectie bestaande uit 
Boris Schmidt op bas, Toon Van Dionant op drums en Bram Weijters op piano. 

*Albert Vila manages to sculpt musical creations that speak to the senses and soul, and provide a window into 
his own unique world - All About Jazz.* 

Albert Vila won in het verleden al de Dutch Jazz Competition en de Jazz Hoeilaart compositie wedstrijd. Hij kiest 
in zijn composities dan ook niet voor platgetreden paden, maar gaat op zoek naar subtiele en uitdagende texturen 
die de luisteraar meenemen. Het zijn zorgvuldig gekozen composities, van intiem tot uitbundig, van melodisch 
tot ritmisch maar altijd interessant om naar te luisteren. 

Albert Vila began his musical studies at the Taller de Musics Barcelona, where he studied with Andy Rossety 
and J. Luis Gamez. In 1999 he was accepted into the Conservatory of Amsterdam and followed the jazz guitar 
performance program, there he had the opportunity to study with Jesse Van Ruller. 

In 2004 he was awarded with the first prize in the Dutch Jazz Competition for his composition Gym Jam. The 
following year the conservatory gave him a scholarship to join the graduate program at the prestigious Manhattan 
School of Music in New York, where he took classes from teachers such as Rodney Jones, Dave Liebman and Phil 
Markowitz. 

In 2007 after completing his post graduate studies he decided to return to his hometown, Barcelona. Once in 
Barcelona, he decided to lead a new project: Albert Vila quintet. With this group in 2007 won the national 
competition in Donosti Debajazz, and is in the same year when the record label Fresh Sound New Talent released 
his debut album Foreground music, ten original songs written and arranged by Albert. During the next two years 
he was busy promoting his album in Spain and working with other artists of the Spanish music scene. 

In 2011 released his second album on Fresh Sound New Talent, entitled Tactile with seven new songs. Albert shows 
his work in Spain and in several European countries including: UK, Germany, Belgium, Italy, Czech Republic and 
Poland, receiving a very warm welcome by both, the public and the critics. 

In 2012, Albert will present his latest album in trio formation, where he is surrounded by the great drummer 
Jorge Rossy and the bass player Reinier Elizarde. This time his repertoire will consist of well-known American 
jazz standards.
