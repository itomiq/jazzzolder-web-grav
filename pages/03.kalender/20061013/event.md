Soo Cho (South Korea) has been playing piano almost all her life. She took classical lessons and was working
as a model. Later she studied classical piano and flute at the Sung Sin University in Seoul. 

After having studied jazz for several years at the conservatories of Utrecht and Amsterdam, 
Soo Cho decided to form her own trio. She had been writing (and is still doing so) 
quite some music and felt the desire to make a band and get her music out there. 

The trio rehearsed intensively during a period of 2 years while they also were organizing 
the Jam sessions at the DJS Jazz club in Dordrecht. 

In 2004 the trio started playing monthly lunch concerts monthly at Baseline Theater and is still doing so. 

The music of the trio is melodic, its Jazz, its original ..... There is hints of Jarrett, shades of Mehldau, 
reminiscence of Pieranunzi, but mostly the world of an original composer: Soo Cho.
