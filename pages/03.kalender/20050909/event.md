title: Djazzperado rides again

DJAZZPERADO! was founded in 1983 by Dutch/Portuguese baritonesaxophonist 
and clarinet player **Han Wezenaar** and Amsterdam singer Astrid Seriese. 

It has developed into an international pool of experienced jazzmusicians 
of all kinds, styles and instruments. They have one thing in common, 
they all share an appetite in playing jazz with the baritonesaxophone 
as a lead melody voice. And that is certainly not common! 
Besides that, all poolmembers go for the "latin tingue". 
Poolmaster is still Han Wezenaar. 

We think the baritonesax is the most saxiest of all saxes. 
The saxophone for sure is one of the most open and free, 
versatile and democratic, musical instruments in the world. 
The bari, being the first saxophone of the whole saxophone-family 
Adolphe Sax invented (around 1841), is on top. Excellent for playing jazz!
