---
Born in 2004 during the Brussels jazz marathon, this quartet presents a repertoire of modern jazz, 
for the most part composed of original material written by the young guitarist Fabrizio Graceffa. 

This music is inspired by the sound of new jazz players from the actual underground New York jazz scene.
Influences: Kenny Wheeler, John Scofield, Kurt Rosenwinkel, Chris Potter... 

The German-Belgian trumpet player Peer Baierlein plays with much imagination and excellent phrasing, 
primarily in the great tradition of the 50s and 60s including, among others, Kenny Dorham, 
and secondly in the post-bop canon à la mode of Tom Harrell. (Juul Anthonissen) 

Yannick Peeters on bass and Herman Pardon on drums, who form the rhythm section, are well known on the Belgian scene. 
They have a background in modern music which makes them ideal partners for this project.
