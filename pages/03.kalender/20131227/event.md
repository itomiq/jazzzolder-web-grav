Op de vooravond van de "onnozele kinderen" geen "simpele" jongens op het podium van de jazzzolder, maar stevige jazzmuzikanten! 

Zo omschrijven ze zichzelf: 

*"When Jeroen Capens came in this world, he instantly knew planet earth was waiting for a messiah to translate outer space signals to sweet sweet music.
 With the weight of the universe on his shoulders he quickly called on two companions to fulfill his destiny. 

 PJ Seaux, expert in low frequencies, was soon to be engaged in his quest along with Steven Van Gelder, director of the satellite-dishes.
 Together they work using a top-secret codename: 'Quartier Clich√©', because chicks dig french!"*
