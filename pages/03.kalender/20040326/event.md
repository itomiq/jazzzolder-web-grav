Met verschillende groepen (o.a. Take the Duke, Toine Thys Homebase Party, Niels Bjerg Quartet e.v.a.)
speelde ook hij al regelmatig in het buitenland. 

Voor het optreden op de jazzzolder omringt hij zich met 3 muzikanten met internationale roots. 

After studying at the 'Musiarte' Scholl in Rio de Janeiro, he decided to continu his 
studies in Europe. In 1993, he joins the jazz department of the Brussels Conservatory, 
and obtains a First Prize for guitar (1995) and harmony (1999). 

In the same period, he already plays with some of the best musicians of the Belgina jazz scene.
In 2000, he goes back to Brazil for 2 years, where he plays a.o. with : Idriss Boudrioua, 
Dario Galante, Osmar Milito, Adriano Giffoni, LuizaoÉ 

Back in Belgim since January 2002, Victor appears with his own trio and with numerous ensembles. 
Among the bands and musicians he played with : DGIL, CACAU E GRUPO, Marito CORREA, 
Steve HOUBEN, Erik VERMEULEN, Michel HERR, Gino LATTUCA, Jan DE HAAS, Denise BLUE, etc... 

In Sweden he formed the trio "Trikta" together with André Burström (guitar) and Liselotte 
Sundberg (vocals), the trio has toured in Sweden giving workshops and concerts in folk 
highschools and music venues and is going to record their first cd this summer. 

All during his studies Claus has performed with several international artists. He has 
toured in Holland, Belgium, Austria, Spain, Sweden, Germany. He is working with many 
diffeent bands among others the quartet "Take the Duck" a promising international 
band who has just released their first cd "Resolution". 

Claus is known among his fellow musicians as an extremely sensitive, responsive and 
musical player. He is a popular call. 

He has performed with people like: Jasper Blom, Natalie Loriers, Lils Mackintosch, 
Ben Sluijs, Steve Altenberg, Christoph Erbstößer, Eric Surmenian, Harmen Fraanje, 
Eric Vermeulen, Lieven Venken, Lisen Rylander and many others. 

Met het Roman Pokorny Quartet, Karel Ruzicka Jr., Tutu nam hij verschillende cd's op.
In Tsjechië is men niet zo gelukkig dat hij naar onze contreien verhuisd is, getuige volgende tekst: 

"Since the **Robert Balzar Trio** was formed nearly three years ago, it has developed into the countrys 
best jazz combo. Mácha has blossomed into a marvelous pianist. His playing has become assured and muscular, 
but without losing the sensitivity that distinguishes him from other pianists his age. Marek Patrman has always 
been a powerful and creative percussionist. With Balzar, he has developed discipline and tact. 

The sad news is that Marek Patrman is currently in Belgium, looking for a more felicitous setting in 
which to practice his trade, which could signify the end of the trio (Robert Balzar trio)".
